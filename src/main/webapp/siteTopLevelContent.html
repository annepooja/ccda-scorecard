      R2.1 Scorecard</h2>
    <p>The SITE C-CDA R2.1 Scorecard provides an enhanced level of
      interoperability for C-CDA documents by using a comprehensive
      scoring system, which allows implementers to improve the data
      quality and representation of their C-CDA documents, thereby
      increasing the precision of documents used in the real-world. The
      C-CDA R2.1 Scorecard scores a C-CDA document against a specified
      set of criteria and provides feedback on potential improvements.
      The SITE C-CDA R2.1 Scorecard goes above and beyond the 2015 S&amp;CC
      requirements by providing feedback based on the content of the
      provided C-CDA document.</p>

    <p>The C-CDA Validator validates the conformance of C-CDA
      documents to the respective HL7 C-CDA Implementation Guide as well
      as the ONC 2014 and 2015 Certification Editions' regulations and
      objectives. The SITE C-CDA Scorecard compliments the validator
      testing by providing an enhanced level of non-standard based
      criteria deemed important for interoperability.</p>
