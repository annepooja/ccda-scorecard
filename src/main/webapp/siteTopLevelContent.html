      R2.1 Scorecard</h2> -->
    <p>The C-CDA Scorecard based on the early work done by the
      SMART team, promotes best practices in C-CDA implementation by
      assessing key aspects of the structured data found in individual
      documents. It's a tool to help implementers gain visibility into
      how well and how often best practices are followed &mdash; and
      also to summarize progress with a rough quantitative assessment,
      highlighting improvements that can be made today. These best
      practices and quantitative scoring criteria have been developed by
      HL7 through the HL7-ONC Cooperative agreement to improve
      standards.</p>
