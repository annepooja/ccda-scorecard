    <p>
      The Scorecard tool has been developed to help improve
      interoperability of Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture
      (C-CDA) documents by providing a means to test the C-CDA documents
      more rigorously, beyond the requirements of 2015 Edition Health IT
      Certification Regulation. This is an enhancement of the <a
        href="http://ccda-scorecard.smartplatforms.org/static/ccdaScorecard/#/">tool
        initially developed by the SMART team</a> from Harvard.
        Health Level 7 (HL7) Standards Development Organization, which
      maintains the C-CDA Standard, has developed the rules and scoring
      criteria used in the tool. Please <a
        href="resources/C-CDA_Scorecard_Rubrics.pptx">click here to
        view the scoring criteria</a>.
        We hope that providers and health IT developers will use the
      tool to identify and resolve issues of C-CDA document
      interoperability among disparate systems.

    <h2 style="font-size: 24px">Interpreting Scorecard Results</h2>
    <p>The scorecard tool provides two scores:
    <ol>
      <li>Certification Score</li>
      <li>Grade</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>The "Certification Score" indicates whether the C-CDA
      document meets the requirements of the 2015 Edition Health IT
      Certification and the result is indicated simply as "Pass" or
      "Fail".</p>
    <p>Additionally, each C-CDA document is scored and graded for
      set of enhanced interoperability rules developed by HL7. A higher
      score (grade) means that information is coded with appropriate
      structure and semantics and hence has a better chance of
      interoperating with disparate system. The maximum score is 100
      points and the grades are:
    <ul>
      <li>A+ (more than 94 points)</li>
      <li>A- (90 to 94 points)</li>
      <li>B+ (85 to 89 points)</li>
      <li>B- (80 to 84 points)</li>
      <li>C (70 to 79 points)</li>
      <li>D (less than 70 points)</li>
    </ul>
