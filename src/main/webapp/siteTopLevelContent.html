    <p>
      The C-CDA Scorecard is based on <a
        href="http://ccda-scorecard.smartplatforms.org/static/ccdaScorecard/#/">work
        completed by the SMART team</a> and promotes best practices in C-CDA
      implementation by assessing key aspects of the structured data
      found in individual documents. It is a tool designed to allow
      implementers to gain insight and information regarding industry
      best practice and usage overall. It also provides a
      rough quantitative assessment and highlights areas of improvement which can be made today to move
      the needle forward. The <a
        href="resources/C-CDA_Scorecard_Rubrics.pptx"> best
        practices and quantitative scoring criteria</a> have been developed
      by HL7 through the HL7-ONC Cooperative agreement to improve the
      implementation of health care standards. We hope that providers
      and health IT developers will use the tool to identify and resolve
      issues of C-CDA document interoperability among disparate systems.

    <h2 style="font-size: 24px">Interpreting Scorecard Results</h2>
    <p>The scorecard tool provides two scores:
    <ol>
      <li>Certification Score</li>
      <li>Grade</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>The "Certification Score" indicates whether the C-CDA
      document meets the requirements of the 2015 Edition Health IT
      Certification and the result is indicated simply as "Pass" or
      "Fail".</p>
    <p>Additionally, each C-CDA document is scored and graded for
      set of enhanced interoperability rules developed by HL7. A higher
      score (grade) means that information is coded with appropriate
      structure and semantics and hence has a better chance of
      interoperating with disparate system. The maximum score is 100
      points and the grades are:
    <ul>
      <li>A+ (more than 94 points)</li>
      <li>A- (90 to 94 points)</li>
      <li>B+ (85 to 89 points)</li>
      <li>B- (80 to 84 points)</li>
      <li>C (70 to 79 points)</li>
      <li>D (less than 70 points)</li>
    </ul>
