                <li>The C-CDA Scorecard leverages the work
                  completed by an ONC-funded grant &mdash; <a
                  href="https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/substitutable-medical-apps-reusable-technologies"
                  target='_blank'>SMART (Substitutable Medical Apps
                    Reusable Technologies)</a> and promotes best practices
                  in C-CDA implementation by assessing key aspects of
                  the structured data found in individual documents. It
                  is a tool designed to allow implementers to gain
                  insight and information regarding industry best
                  practice and usage overall. It also provides a rough
                  quantitative assessment and highlights areas of
                  improvement which can be made today to move the needle
                  forward. The <a

                    scoring criteria</a> have been developed by HL7 through
                  the HL7-ONC Cooperative agreement to improve the
                  implementation of health care standards. We hope that
                  providers and health IT developers will use the tool
                  to identify and resolve issues of C-CDA document
                  interoperability in their health IT systems.

                    <li>Updated Try Me to support multiple
                        files (a high and low scoring sample and a

                    <li>Embolden heat map text by default
                        and hover attributes so that categories are both

                        Certification or Conformance when a section has
                        related issues versus jumping to a no-issue
                        scorecard result</li>
                    <li>Categories (including Conformance
                        and Certification) which have no issues are no
                        longer shown in the detailed results which
                        allows for a cleaner, more focused interface</li>
                    <li>Updated IG/Cert. links to navigate
                        via their label versus error count alone</li>

                        text to the end of each rubrics description
                        versus in its own tab</li>
                    <li>Updated to not load 'Detailed
                        Results' button on a full pass scenario
                        (100/100)</li>
